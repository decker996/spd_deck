# Brainstorm Game Ideas

You are helping the user brainstorm a new DendryNexus game or expand an existing one.

## Instructions

1. **Read the brainstorming guide:** `docs/ai-guides/04-brainstorming.md`

2. **Start with high-level concept:**
   - Ask about genre, setting, and player role
   - Help craft an elevator pitch
   - Clarify scope and target playtime

3. **Define core systems:**
   - Primary resources/stats (3-5 key variables)
   - Time structure (turns, months, continuous)
   - Decision structure (always available, deck-based, event-driven)
   - Win/loss conditions

4. **Narrative elements:**
   - Key characters and their roles
   - Major story beats/events
   - Thematic questions the game asks

5. **Document the results:**
   - Create/update `docs/game-design/concept.md`
   - Create/update `docs/game-design/mechanics.md`
   - Create/update `docs/game-design/narrative.md`

## Approach

- **Ask questions** - Don't assume, clarify the vision
- **Suggest alternatives** - Offer multiple options for each decision
- **Reference examples** - Point to SPD_DECK or other games as inspiration
- **Think about feasibility** - Consider scope and complexity
- **Be enthusiastic** - This is the fun part of game development!

## Output

After the brainstorming session, create a summary document with:
- Elevator pitch
- Core loop diagram
- Key variables list
- Major milestones/events list
- Next steps for implementation

Start by asking: "What kind of game do you want to create?"
