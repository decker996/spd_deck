**Genre:** [Political sim / Adventure / Mystery / Strategy / etc.]
**Target Playtime:** [15 minutes / 1 hour / 3+ hours]
**Status:** [Concept / In Development / Playable / Complete]

## Elevator Pitch

In **[setting]**, you play as **[role]** trying to **[goal]**.

Through **[core mechanic]**, you must **[challenge]** or face **[consequence]**.

---

## Core Concept

### Setting
- **Time Period:** [When does this take place?]
- **Location:** [Where does this take place?]
- **World State:** [What's the status quo? What tensions exist?]

- **What's your power?** [What can you actually do?]
- **What are your limits?** [What constrains you?]

### Core Appeal
**Why is this fun?**
- [ ] Strategic depth (planning, optimization)
- [ ] Narrative engagement (characters, story)
- [ ] Role-playing (identity, decisions)
- [ ] Replayability (multiple paths, randomness)
- [ ] Challenge (difficulty, mastery)
- [ ] Theme/setting (unique premise, interesting world)

## Core Loop

```
[Start State]
    ↓
[Player sees options]
    ↓
[Player makes choice]
    ↓
[Consequences play out]
    ↓
[State changes]
    ↓
[Repeat until win/loss]
```

**Detailed Loop:**
1. [Step 1 - e.g., "New month begins, cards drawn"]
2. [Step 2 - e.g., "Player selects action from deck"]
3. [Step 3 - e.g., "Effects applied, resources change"]
4. [Step 4 - e.g., "Time advances, events may trigger"]
5. [Step 5 - e.g., "Check win/loss conditions"]
6. [Return to step 1 or end game]

---

## Victory Conditions

**How do you win?**
- **Primary:** [Main win condition]
- **Alternate:** [Other paths to victory, if any]
- **Timing:** [When is victory determined? End of game, specific date, etc.]

**Examples:**
- Reach [goal] by [deadline]
- Maintain [state] for [duration]
- Achieve [threshold] (resources, support, etc.)

---

## Defeat Conditions

**How do you lose?**

**Hard Failures** (instant game over):
- [Condition 1 - e.g., "Resources reach 0"]
- [Condition 2 - e.g., "Assassinated by rival"]
- [Condition 3 - e.g., "Failed coup"]

**Soft Failures** (gradual decline):
- [Mechanic 1 - e.g., "Support drops → lose elections → marginalized"]
- [Mechanic 2 - e.g., "Dissent rises → party splits → no power"]

**Can you recover from mistakes?**
- [ ] Yes, several mistakes allowed
- [ ] Yes, but mistakes compound
- [ ] Limited - 1-2 mistakes tolerated
- [ ] No, must play near-perfectly

## Scope and Content

### Length
- **Game Duration:** [In-game time, e.g., "1928-1933 (5 years)"]
- **Player Decisions:** [Approximately how many meaningful choices?]
- **Estimated Playtime:** [Real-world hours to complete]

### Content Breakdown
- **Core scenes:** ~[10-20] (initialization, main loop, status screens)
- **Regular cards:** ~[20-50] (repeatable actions)
- **Events:** ~[20-100] (one-time or rare triggers)
- **Total scenes:** ~[50-200+]

### Branching
- [ ] Linear with variations (one main path, minor branches)
- [ ] Medium branching (several major paths)
- [ ] Highly branching (many different paths and endings)
- [ ] Roguelike (procedural content, high replayability)
